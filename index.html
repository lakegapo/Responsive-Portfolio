      <img src="assets/images/FletchCartoon.png" class="auth-image" alt="Fletcher Profile Pic">

      <p>I have 20 years of experience in telecommunications and information technology.  Much of my background is in networking and unified communications.  I have worked for small, medium and large enterprises and deployed solutions for government, healthcare and financial businesses.  I have a B.S. in Management Information Systems and hold several technology certifications.</p>

      <p>I am now venturing into the field of coding.  It is plainly evident that even in the current field in which I work in, workflows could be made simpler via automation.  In a few months, I hope to be able to apply the learnings from this coding bootcamp into my current day-to-day activities.</p>
